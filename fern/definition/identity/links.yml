        Begins the process for linking an identity with the Rivet Hub.
        # Importance of Linking Identities
        When an identity is created via `rivet.api.identity#SetupIdentity`, the identity is temporary
        and is not shared with other games the user plays.
        In order to make the identity permanent and synchronize the identity with
        other games, the identity must be linked with the hub.
        # Linking Process
        The linking process works by opening `identity_link_url` in a browser then polling
        `rivet.api.identity#GetGameLink` to wait for it to complete.
        This is designed to be as flexible as possible so `identity_link_url` can be opened
        on any device. For example, when playing a console game, the user can scan a
        QR code for `identity_link_url` to authenticate on their phone.
