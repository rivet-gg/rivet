        marks the player as connected.
        # Player Tokens and Reserved Slots
        Player tokens reserve a spot in the lobby until they expire. This allows for
        precise matchmaking up to exactly the lobby's player limit, which is
        important for games with small lobbies and a high influx of players.
        By calling this endpoint with the player token, the player's spot is marked
        as connected and will not expire. If this endpoint is never called, the
        player's token will expire and this spot will be filled by another player.
        # Anti-Botting
        Player tokens are only issued by caling `lobbies.join`, calling `lobbies.find`, or
        from the `GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin` event.
        These endpoints have anti-botting measures (i.e. enforcing max player
        limits, captchas, and detecting bots), so valid player tokens provide some
        confidence that the player is not a bot.
        Therefore, it's important to make sure the token is valid by waiting for
        this endpoint to return OK before allowing the connected socket to do
        anything else. If this endpoint returns an error, the socket should be
        disconnected immediately.
        # How to Transmit the Player Token
        The client is responsible for acquiring the player token by caling
        `lobbies.join`, calling `lobbies.find`, or from the `GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin`
        event.  Beyond that, it's up to the developer how the player token is
        transmitted to the lobby.
        If using WebSockets, the player token can be transmitted as a query
        parameter.
        Otherwise, the player token will likely be automatically sent by the client
        once the socket opens. As mentioned above, nothing else should happen until
        the player token is validated.

        If players are not marked as disconnected, lobbies will result with "ghost players" that the matchmaker thinks exist but are no longer connected to the lobby.
