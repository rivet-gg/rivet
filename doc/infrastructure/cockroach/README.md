## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB (referred to as "Cockroach" or "CRDB") is a Postgres-compatible SQL database built to run across multiple nodes and regions. This lets us have a very flexible and fault tolerant architecture for our database across multiple cloud providers and regions.

## What do we use CockroachDB for?

We use CockroachDB for all data that makes sense to be stored in an SQL database.
