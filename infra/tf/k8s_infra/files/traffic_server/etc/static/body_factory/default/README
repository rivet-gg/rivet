This directory contains customizable error page templates for the
Apache Traffic Server.

You can edit the files in this directory to customized HTML error
response pages. The HTML bodies can include ATS logging format
fields, which will be replaced by the current values before the pages
are served to the user.

You can also include sets of directories, each in a different language,
for serving multi-lingual error pages.

Each directory of error pages include a .body_factory_info file, which
contains optional information about the language and character set of
the error page contents.

See the Traffic Server Administrator's Guide and Release Notes for more
information.
