# Contributing

The Rivet repository is a monorepo. Each component has its own README.md
including information on how to develop it.

## Development Quickstart

- [Rivet Cluster](docker/dev-full/README.md)
- [CLI](packages/toolchain/cli/README.md)
- [Actor SDK](sdks/actor/README.md)
- [Site & Docs](site/README.md)
- [Hub](frontend/apps/hub)
- [Examples](examples/README.md)

## Justfile

It's recommended to use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run development commands, though not required.

## Nix Environment

It's recommended to install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download/) in order to build a consistent environment.

Once installed, run `nix-shell` to build your development environment.

## Conventions

- [Naming conventions](./docs-internal/development/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md).
- [Internal <-> External Aliases](./docs-internal/development/INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_ALIASES.md).
