# Lorri

We recommend installing Lorri on the host machine so you don't have to run `nix-shell` every time you enter the source directory.

See installation instructions [here](https://github.com/nix-community/lorri#setup-on-other-platforms).

Once installed, run `dir-env allow` in the project root.
