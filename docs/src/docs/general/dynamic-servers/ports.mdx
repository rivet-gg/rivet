# Ports

When running a game on Rivet, you need to expose ports for players to connect to your lobby.

By default, Rivet uses [Rivet Game Guard](/docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/game-guard) to enable DDoS mitigation and TLS termination out of the box. We recommend using this whenever possible, but on rare occasion you will need to use [host networking](/docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/host-bridge-networking).

## Connecting to your game

When [finding a lobby](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find), Rivet returns map of `ports` with the address and port to connect to.

Unless using host networking, there is no static IP address and port exposed for players to connect to your game.
