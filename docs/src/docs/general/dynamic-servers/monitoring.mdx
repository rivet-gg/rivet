# Monitoring

Rivet provides a system for monitoring hardware metrics & lobby crashes in real-time for free. This is a great way to monitor your game's performance and stability. Your server is monitored automatically and can be viewed on the Rivet Hub.

## Memory usage

Currently the memory usage for a lobby will not be a 1-to-1 match with memory you might observe manually from
within the runtime of your game. This is because the memory usage includes the processes that collect logs and
metrics from all lobbies.
