	**Why can't I use 'Launch Separate Server'?**
	Ideally, you would be able to test a dedicated server from Unreal Engine's editor with these settings:

    - **Multiplayer Options -> Launch Separate Server**: true
    - **Multiplayer Options -> Play Net Mode**: Standalone
    - **Multiplayer Options -> Run Under One Process**: True
    - **Server -> Server Map Name Override**: /Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/ThirdPersonMap

    However, there's a bug in Unreal Engine that causes the spawned standalone clients to use the *Server Map Name Override*, which makes this useless.

## Quick iteration: PIE + listen server

This setting is useful for quick iteration.

Open _Edit -> Editor Preferences -> Level Editor -> Play_ and update the following settings:

- **Multiplayer Options -> Launch Separate Server**: True
- **Multiplayer Options -> Play Net Mode**: Play Standalone
- **Multiplayer Options -> Run Under One Process**: False
- **Client -> Play Number Of Clients**: >= 2
- **Server -> Server Map Name Override**: _Empty_

<Warning>
	Be aware that running as a listen server may behave differently than with a dedicated server if [actor authority](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/networking-overview-for-unreal-engine/#networkroleandauthority) is not handled correctly.

    Using a listen server means that all actors have `Role == ROLE_Authority`. In production, actors will have `Role == ROLE_SimulatedProxy`. Read more [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/actor-role-and-remoterole-in-unreal-engine/).

    Check your functionality with PIE + standalone server if you think you might be having issues.

</Warning>

## Testing authority: PIE + standalone server

This setting is useful for:

- Testing the offline -> online flow of a user joining a server
- Testing actor roles are handled correctly with a dedicated server (i.e. as close to production as possible)

Open _Edit -> Editor Preferences -> Level Editor -> Play_ and update the following settings:

- **Multiplayer Options -> Launch Separate Server**: False
- **Multiplayer Options -> Play Net Mode**: Standalone
- **Multiplayer Options -> Run Under One Process**: True
- **Client -> Play Number Of Clients**: >= 2
- **Server -> Server Map Name Override**: _Empty_

## Testing for release: standalone client + standalone server

TODO

This is useful for release testing locally.

- Build debug client
- Build debug server
- Bake client
- Bake server
- Open server binary
- Open client binary

## Testing on Rivet's servers: standalone client + Rivet server

TODO

This is useful for testing Rivet functionality in production.

- Publish to Rivet
- Use a public token on localhost
