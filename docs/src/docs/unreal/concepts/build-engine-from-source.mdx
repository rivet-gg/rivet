# Build Unreal Engine from source

<Warning>
   **You probably don't need this**

   Rivet provides an automated process for building Unreal dedicated servers without building the engine from source.

   If you're not using Rivet, you traditionally need to build Unreal Engine from source to build a dedicated server.

   This is only needed if you're using an Unreal Engine fork or need access to functionality that Rivet does not provide.
</Warning>

This guide will walk you through building Unreal Engine from source in order to build Linux dedicated server packages.

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio prerequisites

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/)

## Step 2: Download the Unreal Engine source code

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/)

1. Connect your Epic account to GitHub
1. Clone the [UnrealEngine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) repository **to a permanent location.** Make sure you're cloning the `release` branch. This will take a long time.

You will build the Unreal Engine source code in a later step.

## Step 3: Download and install the Unreal Engine cross-compilation toolchain

Download the cross-compilation toolchain corresponding to the version of Unreal Engine you downloaded in the previous step.

[Download here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine/)

<Warning>
  Make sure you have the correct version installed or else Unreal Engine will say it's not installed in a
  later step.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Build the Unreal Engine editor

TODO: Look at other demos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGq-XK8mffg)

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/)

1. Install Visual Studio prerequisites
   - TODO: See Setting Up Visual Studio -> C++ Tools
1. `.\Setup.bat`
1. `.\GenerateProjectFiles.bat`
   - You'll see a warning: `Some Platforms were skipped due to invalid SDK setup:`
   - Make sure that `Linux` is not listed here. If so, then step 1 was not done correctly.
1. Open UE5.sln
1. Wait for _Indexing folder UnrealEngine_ to finish
   - You can see this by clicking the messae tab in the bottom left
1. Set _Solution Configuration_ to _Development Editor_
1. Set _Solution Platform_ to _Win64_
1. Right click _UE5_ target in right sidebar and click _Build_
   - Takes 10-40 minutes depending on your hardware
1. Right click on _UE5_ in the sidebar and click _Debug -> Start New Instance_
1. Unreal Engine is built to at `UnrealEngine\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor`
   - Create a shortcut somewhere for quick access in the future

## Step 5: Build your project's Linux dedicated server

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-dedicated-servers-in-unreal-engine/)

Once you have Unreal Engine built from source, open your project and package it for Linux.

1. Select _Platforms > Linux > Debug_
	- If deploying to production, select _Release_ instead. We use _Debug_ here so we can catch any crashes while testing.
2. Select _Platform > Linux > MyProjectServer_
3. Validate the config looks like this:
   <Image src={srcLinuxServerPlatform} alt='Linux server paltform config' />
4. Click _Platforms > Linux > Package Project_
5. Package the project to _MyProject/Binaries/Linux/Server_. **This path is important since the Dockerfile we provide relies on it.**

<Tip>
	If the Linux option does not show up or gives you errors, you may have installed the wrong version of the Linux toolchain. Go back to Step 1 then restart Unreal Engine.
