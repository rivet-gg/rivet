# Quickstart

Unreal Engine provides great multiplayer capabilities out of the box. We'll use Unreal's built-in networking to build and deploy a server-authoritative multiplayer game on top of Rivet.

## Goals

- Deploy & distribute a multiplayer Unreal Engine dedicated game server to Rivet
- Build a basic menu screen for a multiplayer game
- How to test multiplayer games locally

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Unreal Engine 5 GitHub access](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github)
- [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
  - This guide was written using Unreal Engine 5.2.1.
- About 60 GB of free space (for Unreal Engine Linux build)


## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='How does Rivet compare to Epic Online Services and Steam Sockets?'>
        Rivet is intended to help run authoritative multiplayer servers. We do not support peer-to-peer networking yet.

        Read more about [authoritative vs peer-to-peer networking](/docs/general/concepts/authoritative-vs-p2p).

        If you want high-performance networking, mobile games, large lobbies, or to prevent cheating, peer-to-peer networking is not a good choice.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Does Rivet support Unreal Engine 4?'>
        This guide is built for Unreal Engine 5.

        If you're using a different version of Unreal Engine and need help, please [reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Do I need to build the editor from scratch?'>
        You do **not** need to build the Unreal editor yourself to follow this guide.

        Rivet's build system uses Unreal Docker containers to simplify development & deployment.
    </Accordion>
	<Accordion title='What if I want to build Unreal Engine from source instead of using Docker?'>
		It's also possible to build your dedicated server by [building Unreal Engine from source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/). This requires many more prerequisites with a complicated & error prone setup process, so we use Epic's Docker image instead.

		However, this may be required if using a fork of Unreal Engine. Please [reach out](https://discord.com/invite/BG2vqsJczH) if you need help making this work with Rivet.
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Setup Unreal Engine project

We'll use the third-person template from Unreal Engine. All the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other Unreal Engine games.

<Warning>
  If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your project is version controlled before
  making any changes.
</Warning>

### Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry

We need to authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to be able to pull the Unreal Engine Docker image.

1. Make sure you already have Unreal Engine GitHub Access [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github).
2. Authenticate with [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

### Create project from template (or bring your own project)

1. Create a third-person template with the C++ version. We'll create a guide for using Blueprints instead of C++ soon.
2. Set _Quality Preset_, _Starter Content_, and _Raytracing_ to anything.
3. Click _Create_.
	<Image src={imgCreateThirdPerson} alt='Third person create dialog' />
4. Open the Visual Studio project by clicking _Tools > Open Visual Studio_.
	<Image src={imgOpenVisualStudio} alt='Open visual studio' />

### Add server target

We need to add a target so you can compile your game as a dedicated server to run on Rivet.

Create a file at `Source/MyProjectServer.Target.cs` with the following. Replace `MyProject` with your project's name.

```csharp {{"file": "Source/MyProjectServer.Target.cs"}}
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectServerTarget : TargetRules
{
	public MyProjectServerTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
	{
		Type = TargetType.Server;
		DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
		IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_1;
		ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyProject");
	}
}
```

## Step 2: Integrate Rivet

### Install Rivet CLI

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS & Linux & WSL">
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rivet-gg/cli/v1.3.4/install/unix.sh | sh
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
```sh
powershell -Command "iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rivet-gg/cli/v1.3.4/install/windows.ps1 -useb | iex"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Validate that the version of your CLI is `1.3.4` by running `rivet --version`.
</Info>

### Initiate project

Run the following in your project's directory and follow the steps.

```bash
rivet init --unreal --install-plugin
```

### Add dependency

Add Rivet to `PrivateDependencyModuleNames` in your project `Source/MyProject/MyProject.Build.cs`. For example:

```csharp {{"file": "Source/MyProject/MyProject.Build.cs"}}
PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Rivet" });
```

### Update `AMyProjectGameMode` class

We will update the game mode code to connect player connect & disconnect events to Rivet.

Update the the game `MyProjectGameMdoe` header & source files to look like the following. Replace `MyProject` with your project name.

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title='Source/MyProject/MyProjectGameMode.h'>
	```cpp

	}
	```
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Restart Unreal Engine for the new C++ header to take effect.

## Step 3: Build game menu UI

We will build a simple menu UI that will allow players to connect to a server. This will be the first thing players see when they start the game. We will also update the default map to be the menu UI instead of the game world.

### Create the menu UI world

1. Create a new level in _File -> New Level..._
2. Select _Empty Level_
3. Click _File -> Save Current Level_ or press _Ctrl + S_. Save in _All/Content/Third Person/Maps_ and name it _Entry_.
4. Change the game mode by clicking the Blueprint dropdown and then clicking _World Override -> Game Mode: Not overridden! -> Select GameModeBase Class -> GameModeBase_ - This will remove the game mode logic to create a pure menu screen
   <Image src={imgSetGameModeBase} alt='Set game mode base' />

### Create the menu widget

1. Open the _Content Drawer_
2. Open _All/Content/ThirdPerson/UI_
   - You may have to create this folder
3. Right-click in the content area and click _User Interface -> Widget Blueprint_
   <Image src={imgCreateWidgetBlueprint} alt='Create widget blueprint' />
4. Click _User Widget_
   <Image src={imgUserWidget} alt='User widget' />
5. Rename it to _EntryWidget_

### Design menu widget

<CrashCourseUnrealWidget />

1. Open the _EntryWidget_ you created
2. Construct the following design:
   <Image src={imgEntryWidgetDesign} alt='Entry widget design' />

### Write widget blueprint to connect to server when button is clicked

<CrashCourseUnrealBlueprint />

1. Create a development token by running the following command and copying the token. It should look like `dev_staging.XXXX`. Save this for the next step.
   ```bash
   rivet token dev create
   ```
2. Open the Blueprint code for the _EntryWidget_ you created by clicking _Graph_ in the top right corner
   - Replace `MY_TOKEN` with the token you just created.
3. Construct the following Blueprint:
   <Image src={imgEntryWidgetBlueprint} alt='Entry widget blueprint' />
4. Press _Compile_

This widget can now be used to connect a player to a server.


### Add the menu widget to the entry level

1. Open the level Blueprint by clicking the Blueprint dropdown and then clicking _Open Level Blueprint_
   <Image src={imgOpenLevelBlueprint} alt='Open level blueprint' />
2. Construct the following Blueprint:
   <Image src={imgEntryLevelBlueprint} alt='Entry level blueprint' />
3. Press _Compile_

### Update the default map

Now that we have a new _Entry_ map for the UI, we need to make it the default map.

1. Open _Edit -> Project Settings..._
2. Click on _Maps & Modes_ under _Projects_ in the sidebar
   - You can also search for "map" in the search bar
3. Change _Game Default Map_ to _/Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/Entry_
3. Change _Advanced > Server Default Map_ to _/Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/ThirdPersonMap_

### Set up play configuration for testing multiplayer

We will configure the play settings to test the game with Rivet locally in your editor.

1. Press the three dots next to the play button and click _Advanced Settings_ to open the _Play In_ settings.

   <Image src={imgPlaySettings} alt='Play settings' />

2. Scroll down to _Multiplayer Options_. Update the following settings:

   - **Launch Separate Server**: False
   - **Play Net Mode**: Play Standalone
   - **Run Under One Process**: True
     <Image src={imgMultiplayerOptionsSettings} alt='Multiplayer options settings' />

3. Update the number of players to at least 2.

   <Image src={imgNumberPlayers} alt='Change number of players' />

<Tip>
	Learn more about different ways to run your multiplayer game in Unreal Engine [here](/docs/unreal/concepts/run-methods).
</Tip>



### Test the game server locally

**Run server**

This will build & run your game server locally and run on port 7777. You must re-run this command whenever you change your server code.

```bash
rivet unreal start-server
```

**Run client**

1. Switch to the main editor
2. Validate that the _Entry_ level is open
3. Click _Play_ 
4. Click _Connect_ in each of the game instances created
5. You should be able to see each player running around in sync

<Image src={imgFinalDemo} alt='Final demo' />

This is using the Rivet development token to mock production APIs. This lets you test with production APIs while still using your local machine.

## Step 4: Deploy to Rivet & distribute game

### Deploy to Rivet

In the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
rivet deploy -n prod
```

This will deploy your project to your game's production namespace.

### Test with remote game server locally

Now that your game is deployed to Rivet, you can test using a production namespace token.

1. Create a new namespace token as described [here](/docs/general/concepts/handling-game-tokens#public-namespace-tokens).
2. Update the token in the _Entry_ widget blueprint where you set `MY_TOKEN` in the previous step.
3. Play the project and click your _Connect_ button. Check that you are able to see the other player run around.

Your game is now up and running on Rivet!

You can see the lobbies in the Rivet dashboard. These will automatically scale up and down as players come and go.

<Image src={imgRunningLobbies} alt='Running lobbies' />

### Build & distribute client

You can build & distribute the game client as you like. Rivet provides a [CDN](/docs/cdn) to make this easy.

Make sure to change _Rivet Token_ to [public namespace token](/docs/general/concepts/handling-game-tokens#public-namespace-tokens) when distributing builds, like we did in a previous step.

You can also [use Unreal's config files](/docs/unreal/concepts/token-config) to configure the token.
