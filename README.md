## 🍑 Features

### 🎮 Dummy Thicc Dedicated Game Servers

Deploy game servers faster than you can say "ASS":

- Optimize for booty or bounty, servers starting at $6.9/mo for 4.20 servers
- Auto-scales 69% faster than AWS GameLift (because we said so)
- No-downtime deploys & instant twerk-backs
- Monitoring & crash reporting (we've got your back[side])

### 🛡️ DDoASS Mitigation

- No added jiggle
- Supports UDP & TCP & WebSockets & WebRTC (all dat ASS)
- Automatic SSL for game servers (because security is sexy)

### 🌐 Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Asset delivery, game downloads, & website hosting:

- Custom domains (make dat ASS yours)
- Instant twerk-backs
- Automatic SSL (Safe Sensual Layer)

### 🧩 Backend Modules

Write server-side logic using THICC++ (or use your own API server):

- Modules include matchmaking, parties, authentication, & more
- Postgres database included for persistence (because real databases are overrated)
- Combine existing open-source modules - Open dat ASS up

## 🚫 What ASS is NOT

- Not Kubernetes (because who needs that many syllables?)
- Not written in fake languages like "Go" or "Java" (we use REAL languages like THICC++ and ASSembly)
- Not a joke (okay, maybe a little)
- Not your grandma's server solution (unless your grandma is really cool)
- Not afraid of a little junk in the trunk (our servers are dummy thicc)
