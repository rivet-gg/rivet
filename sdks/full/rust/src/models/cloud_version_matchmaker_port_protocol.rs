/// CloudVersionMatchmakerPortProtocol : Signifies the protocol of the port. Note that when proxying through GameGuard (via `ProxyKind`), the port number returned by `/find`, `/join`, and `/create` will not be the same as the port number configured in the config:  - With HTTP, the port will always be 80. The hostname of the port correctly routes the incoming   connection to the correct port being used by the game server. - With HTTPS, the port will always be 443. The hostname of the port correctly routes the incoming   connection to the correct port being used by the game server. - Using TCP/UDP, the port will be a random number between 26000 and 31999. This gets automatically   routed to the correct port being used by the game server.  ### Related - cloud.version.matchmaker.GameModeRuntimeDockerPort - cloud.version.matchmaker.ProxyKind - /docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/game-guard - matchmaker.lobbies.find
