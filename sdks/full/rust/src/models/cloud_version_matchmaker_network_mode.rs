/// CloudVersionMatchmakerNetworkMode : Configures how the container's network is isolated from the host. `bridge` (default) networking isolates the container's network from the host & other containers. `host` networking removes isolation between the container and the host. Only available in Rivet Open Source & Enterprise. Read more about bridge vs host networking [here](https://rivet.gg/docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/host-bridge-networking).
