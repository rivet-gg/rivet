/**
 * Signifies the protocol of the port.
 * Note that when proxying through GameGuard (via `ProxyKind`), the port number returned by `/find`, `/join`, and `/create` will not be the same as the port number configured in the config:
 *
 * - With HTTP, the port will always be 80. The hostname of the port correctly routes the incoming
 *   connection to the correct port being used by the game server.
 * - With HTTPS, the port will always be 443. The hostname of the port correctly routes the incoming
 *   connection to the correct port being used by the game server.
 * - Using TCP/UDP, the port will be a random number between 26000 and 31999. This gets automatically
 *   routed to the correct port being used by the game server.
