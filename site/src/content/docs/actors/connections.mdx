# Connections

Connections represent client connections to your actor. They provide a way to handle client authentication, manage connection-specific data, and control the connection lifecycle.

## Parameters

When clients connect to a actor, they can pass connection parameters that are handled during the connection process.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript actor.ts
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const gameRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  
  // Handle connection setup
  createConnState: (c, { params }) => {
    // Validate authentication token
    const authToken = params.authToken;
    
    if (!authToken || !validateToken(authToken)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid auth token");
    }
    
    // Create connection state
    return { userId: getUserIdFromToken(authToken), role: "player" };
  },
  
  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "rivetkit/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:8080");
const gameRoom = await client.gameRoom.get({
  params: { authToken: "supersekure" }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Connection State

There are two ways to define a actor's connection state:

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="connState constant">
		Define connection state as a constant value:

		```typescript
		import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

		const chatRoom = actor({
		  state: { messages: [] },
		  
		  // Define default connection state as a constant
		  connState: {
		    role: "guest",
		    joinedAt: 0
		  },
		  
		  onConnect: (c) => {
		    // Update join timestamp when a client connects
		    c.conn.state.joinedAt = Date.now();
		  },
		  
		  actions: {
		    // ...
		  }
		});
		```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="createConnState function">
		Create connection state dynamically with a function. The data returned is used as the initial state of the connection. The connection state can be accessed through `conn.state`.

		```typescript
		import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

		const chatRoom = actor({
		  state: { messages: [] },
		  
		  // Create connection state dynamically
		  createConnState: (c) => {
		    // Validate any connection parameters
		    // ...
		    
		    // Return the connection state
		    return { 
		      userId: generateUserId(),
		      role: "guest",
		      joinedAt: Date.now()
		    };
		  },
		  
		  actions: {
		    sendMessage: (c, message) => {
		      const username = c.conn.state.userId;
		      c.state.messages.push({ username, message });
		      c.broadcast("newMessage", { username, message });
		    }
		  }
		});
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Lifecycle Hooks

The connection lifecycle has several hooks:

- `onBeforeConnect`: Called before a client connects, returns the connection state
- `onConnect`: Called when a client successfully connects
- `onDisconnect`: Called when a client disconnects

See the documentation on [Actor Lifecycle](/docs/actors/lifecycle) for more details.

## Connection List

All active connections can be accessed through the context object's `conns` property. This is an array of all current connections.

This is frequently used with `conn.send(name, event)` to send messages directly to clients.

For example:

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { users: {} },
  
  actions: {
    sendDirectMessage: (c, recipientId, message) => {
      // Find the recipient's connection
      const recipientConn = c.conns.find(conn => conn.state.userId === recipientId);
      
      if (recipientConn) {
        // Send a private message to just that client
        recipientConn.send('directMessage', {
          from: c.conn.state.userId,
          message: message
        });
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Disconnecting clients

Connections can be disconnected from within an action:

```typescript
import { actor } from "@rivetkit/actor";

const secureRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  
  actions: {
    kickUser: (c, targetUserId, reason) => {
      // Find the connection to kick
      const targetConn = c.conns.find(conn => conn.state.userId === targetUserId);
      
      if (targetConn) {
        // Disconnect with a reason
        targetConn.disconnect(reason || "Kicked by admin");
      }
    }
  }
});
```

<Tip>
If you need to wait for the disconnection to complete, you can use `await`:

```typescript
await c.conn.disconnect('Too many requests');
```

This ensures the underlying network connections close cleanly before continuing.
</Tip>

## Offline & Auto-Reconnection

See [client documentation](/docs/actors/communicating-with-actors) for details on reconnection behavior.
