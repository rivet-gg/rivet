# Edge Networking

Actors run near your users on Rivet's global network by default.

## Available regions

| Region | Location                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `atl`  | Atlanta, Georgia, USA        |
| `bom`  | Mumbai, India                |
| `fra`  | Frankfurt, Germany           |
| `gru`  | São Paulo, Brazil            |
| `lax`  | Los Angeles, California, USA |
| `osa`  | Osaka, Japan                 |
| `sin`  | Singapore                    |
| `syd`  | Sydney, Australia            |

<Tip title="Don't hardcode regions">
	Dynamically fetching the region list allows you to support more region & develop locally. See [Fetching region list](#fetching-region-list) for more information.

## Region selection

### Automatic region selection

By default, actors will choose the optimal region based on the client's location.

<Note>
	Under the hood, Rivet uses [Anycast routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) to automatically find
	the best location for the client to connect to without relying on slow & expensive manual pinging process.
</Note>

### Manually querying the optimal region

You can query the best regions for your actors using:

```typescript
// Find the best region for your actor
const { region } = await client.actor.regions.resolve({ project, environment });
```

### Configuring the actor's region

The region an actor is created in can be overridden by defining `create.region`:

```typescript {{ "title": "client.ts" }}
const { actor } = await client.actor.create({
  project,
  environment,
  body: {
    tags: { name: "app" },
    buildTags: { name: "app" },
    region: region.id, // Specify the region ID here
    // Other configuration...
  }
});
```

## Fetching region list

It's common to need to display a list of available regions in your application.

To fetch a full list of regions, see [`actor.regions.list`](/docs/api/actor/regions/list). This list is returned in order of best to worst for the client.
