	/// Performs a little-endian comparison of byte strings. If the existing value in the database is not present, then ``param`` is stored in the database. If the existing value in the database is shorter than ``param``, it is first extended to the length of ``param`` with zero bytes.  If ``param`` is shorter than the existing value in the database, the existing value is truncated to match the length of ``param``. The smaller of the two values is then stored in the database.
	Min,
	/// value to which to set the transformed key
	///
	/// Transforms ``key`` using a versionstamp for the transaction. Sets the transformed key in the database to ``param``. The key is transformed by removing the final four bytes from the key and reading those as a little-Endian 32-bit integer to get a position ``pos``. The 10 bytes of the key from ``pos`` to ``pos + 10`` are replaced with the versionstamp of the transaction used. The first byte of the key is position 0. A versionstamp is a 10 byte, unique, monotonically (but not sequentially) increasing value for each committed transaction. The first 8 bytes are the committed version of the database (serialized in big-Endian order). The last 2 bytes are monotonic in the serialization order for transactions. WARNING: At this time, versionstamps are compatible with the Tuple layer only in the Java, Python, and Go bindings. Also, note that prior to API version 520, the offset was computed from only the final two bytes rather than the final four bytes.
