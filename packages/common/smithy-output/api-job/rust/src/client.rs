/// An ergonomic service client for `JobService`.
///
/// This client allows ergonomic access to a `JobService`-shaped service.
/// Each method corresponds to an endpoint defined in the service's Smithy model,
/// and the request and response shapes are auto-generated from that same model.
///
/// # Constructing a Client
///
/// To construct a client, you need a few different things:
///
/// - A [`Config`](crate::Config) that specifies additional configuration
///   required by the service.
/// - A connector (`C`) that specifies how HTTP requests are translated
///   into HTTP responses. This will typically be an HTTP client (like
///   `hyper`), though you can also substitute in your own, like a mock
///   mock connector for testing.
/// - A "middleware" (`M`) that modifies requests prior to them being
///   sent to the request. Most commonly, middleware will decide what
///   endpoint the requests should be sent to, as well as perform
///   authentication and authorization of requests (such as SigV4).
///   You can also have middleware that performs request/response
///   tracing, throttling, or other middleware-like tasks.
/// - A retry policy (`R`) that dictates the behavior for requests that
///   fail and should (potentially) be retried. The default type is
///   generally what you want, as it implements a well-vetted retry
///   policy implemented in [`RetryMode::Standard`](aws_smithy_types::retry::RetryMode::Standard).
///
/// To construct a client, you will generally want to call
/// [`Client::with_config`], which takes a [`aws_smithy_client::Client`] (a
/// Smithy client that isn't specialized to a particular service),
/// and a [`Config`](crate::Config). Both of these are constructed using
/// the [builder pattern] where you first construct a `Builder` type,
/// then configure it with the necessary parameters, and then call
/// `build` to construct the finalized output type. The
/// [`aws_smithy_client::Client`] builder is re-exported in this crate as
/// [`Builder`] for convenience.
///
/// In _most_ circumstances, you will want to use the following pattern
/// to construct a client:
///
/// ```
/// use rivet_job::{Builder, Client, Config};
/// let raw_client =
///     Builder::dyn_https()
/// #     /*
///       .middleware(/* discussed below */)
/// #     */
/// #     .middleware_fn(|r| r)
///       .build();
/// let config = Config::builder().build();
/// let client = Client::with_config(raw_client, config);
/// ```
///
/// For the middleware, you'll want to use whatever matches the
/// routing, authentication and authorization required by the target
/// service. For example, for the standard AWS SDK which uses
/// [SigV4-signed requests], the middleware looks like this:
///
// Ignored as otherwise we'd need to pull in all these dev-dependencies.

///
/// Once you have a client set up, you can access the service's endpoints
/// by calling the appropriate method on [`Client`]. Each such method
/// returns a request builder for that endpoint, with methods for setting
/// the various fields of the request. Once your request is complete, use
/// the `send` method to send the request. `send` returns a future, which
/// you then have to `.await` to get the service's response.
